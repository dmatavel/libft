# libft

This project is about coding a C library.

It is a remake of a set of functions from the `libc` and a implementation of a set functions that are either not in the `libc`, or that are part of it but in a different form).

The functions may have the same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals.

They must comply with the way they are defined in their `man`. The only difference is their names. They begin with the `ft_` prefix. For instance, `strlen` becomes `ft_strlen`.
